## My process

### Built with
Basic HTML and CSS

### What I learned

I mainly started this challenge to refresh my knowledge of basic HTML and CSS since I have been using libraries a lot in my current course. 
It helped me recap on positioning with plain CSS and refreshed me on my knowledge of the DOM.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing my plain CSS and JavaScript skills because I believe that a strong grasp of the basics will be beneficial for me in the future.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com)

- Both the above websites are the first resources I refer to. Another helpful resource I use frequently is Stack Overflow.
